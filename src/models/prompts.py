        - Grammar: Verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, articles, etc.
        - Vocabulary: Word choice and range of expressions
        - Coherence: Logical flow and organization of ideas
        - Cohesion: Use of linking words and transitions
        - Structure: Paragraphing and overall essay structure\n\n
